I'm currently a researcher/software engineer at Computing Infrastructure Lab of Bytedance Inc. My current work focuses on building next-generation AI serving infrastructures. Previously I was a Postdoc Researcher of Computer Science at UT Austin, working with [Prof. Aditya Akella](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~akella/) at UT Networked Systems group ([UTNS](https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/)). I was one of the recipients of [CIFellow 2021](https://cifellows2021.org/2021-class/), supported by both National Science Foundation (NSF) and Computing Research Association (CRA). During my PhD I worked on making real time data processing systems more elastic, under the supervision of [Prof. Indranil Gupta](http://indy.cs.illinois.edu/) at Distributed Protocols Research Group ([DPRG](http://dprg.cs.uiuc.edu/)). My current research mainly revolves around all aspects of resource-efficient cloud computing frameworks, including serverless computing and alternative system architectures. See my [CV]() and list of [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uFyE-AQAAAAJ) here.
Don't hesitate to [contact me](le.xu@bytedance.com) if you're interested in my experience or would like to chat about my recent research! I'm always open to opportunities for collboration and/or full-time research positions.
